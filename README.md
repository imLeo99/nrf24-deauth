# ESP32 NRF24 RF Noise Transmitter

This project uses an **E####** and an **N#######1** module to generate intentional radio frequency (RF) noise by rapidly switching channels and transmitting a constant carrier signal. It is intended strictly for **educational and RF testing purposes** — for example, 
testing how N#####-based devices perform in interference-heavy environments.

⚠️ Legal and Safety Warning

This project transmits continuous signals and randomly hops between frequencies in the **2.4 GHz ISM band**, which is used by Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and many other devices.

❗ **Do NOT use this code in public environments or near other people's wireless equipment.**

In many countries, **deliberate RF interference is illegal** and may lead to:
- Fines
- Equipment confiscation
- Criminal charges

Only run this in **controlled, private environments** (e.g. a Faraday cage or RF-isolated lab). **You are solely responsible** for how you use this code.

## 🧪 Use case

- RF interference testing
- NRF24 resilience testing
- Embedded experimentation

## 🔧 Hardware

- E?@?#?# (any variant)
- N?@?#??#@? module
- Proper power regulation for N@?@#?

## 📄 License

MIT License — but **abuse of this code is not endorsed or supported.**
